I like to play outside. My favorite color is red. Let’s go to the playground. Can I have a cookie? Good morning, Daddy!

Time to brush teeth. Read me a story. It’s bedtime now. I’m hungry, please! Look at the butterflies!

My pet is fluffy. I can tie my shoes! Thank you for helping. I’m sorry for spilling. Walk with me? My birthday is soon.

I miss my friend. Wash hands before eating. Feeling sleepy now. I draw with crayons. Pizza for dinner? Can I have the blue one?

Dogs are cute. Teach me something new. The sun is so bright! My tooth is wiggly. Let’s play hide-and-seek.

Be careful, it’s hot! May I have a hug? I made this for you. Look at the stars! Teach me to ride a bike? Put on your jacket.

I like bananas. Happy to see you! Let’s build a sandcastle. Can I have some water? Feeling better now.

I love to sing. Dinosaurs are cool. Time to clean up. Can I help cook? My turn to play!

Blow bubbles with me? Feeling silly today. Family is important. Rainy days are cozy. Count with me.

I want to be a superhero. Let’s make paper airplanes.
